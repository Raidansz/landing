    Last Updated: April 1, 2025
    
    Welcome to SquareCast, a podcast app developed by Raidan Shugaa Addin (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) in Budapest, Hungary. These Terms of Service (‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) are a legal agreement between you (‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúuser‚Äù) and us, governing your use of SquareCast, including all features, updates, and content (collectively, the ‚ÄúService‚Äù). By using the Service, you accept these Terms in full.
    
    1. Eligibility
    You must be at least 13 years old to use SquareCast, per the U.S. Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar laws. If you‚Äôre under 18, you confirm you have parental consent. We may restrict access in certain regions due to legal or technical limitations.
    
    2. License to Use
    We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use SquareCast for personal, non-commercial purposes. This includes streaming podcasts, downloading for offline use, and accessing transcription, translation, and dubbing features, subject to these Terms.
    
    3. Accounts
    Account creation is optional. If you register via Firebase Authentication, you provide your name, email, and password. You‚Äôre responsible for:
    - Keeping your credentials confidential.
    - All activity under your account, authorized or not.
    Notify us immediately at support@squarecast.app if you suspect unauthorized access. We may suspend accounts for security or policy breaches.
    
    4. Acceptable Use
    You agree not to:
    - Copy, distribute, or sell SquareCast or its content (e.g., podcasts, translations) without permission.
    - Reverse-engineer, decompile, or hack the app.
    - Use the Service for illegal activities (e.g., piracy, fraud).
    - Harass or impersonate others via account features.
    - Overload our servers (e.g., excessive downloads) or interfere with other users‚Äô access.
    - Scrape or harvest data from the app.
    Violation may result in account suspension, termination, or legal action.
    
    5. Content
    - Third-Party Podcasts: SquareCast streams content from external providers. We don‚Äôt control or endorse this content and aren‚Äôt liable for its accuracy, legality, or availability.
    - Translations/Dubbing: Our AI-generated translations and dubs aim for accuracy but may contain errors. They‚Äôre for convenience, not official use.
    - Ownership: We own SquareCast‚Äôs code, design, and branding. Podcast content belongs to its creators or licensors.
    
    6. Future Payments (Placeholder)
    Currently, SquareCast is free. If we introduce subscriptions, in-app purchases, or premium features (e.g., ad-free listening), pricing and terms will be disclosed via the App Store. Payments will follow Apple‚Äôs policies, including cancellations and refunds. We‚Äôll update these Terms accordingly.
    
    7. Termination
    - By You: Delete your account in Settings or stop using SquareCast.
    - By Us: We may suspend or terminate your access for violating these Terms, legal requirements, or operational needs (e.g., app discontinuation), with or without notice. Upon termination, your license ends, but Sections 5, 8, 9, and 11 survive.
    
    8. Disclaimer of Warranties
    SquareCast is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available.‚Äù We don‚Äôt guarantee:
    - Uninterrupted or error-free service (e.g., due to server outages or podcast feed issues).
    - Accuracy of translations, transcriptions, or dubbing.
    - Compatibility with all devices or iOS versions.
    External factors (e.g., internet failure) are beyond our control.
    
    9. Limitation of Liability
    To the fullest extent permitted by law (including Hungarian and EU law), we, our affiliates, and partners aren‚Äôt liable for:
    - Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (e.g., lost data, profits).
    - Issues from third-party content or services (e.g., podcast outages, Firebase downtime).
    - Damages exceeding ‚Ç¨50 or the amount you paid us (if any).
    This applies even if we‚Äôre notified of potential issues.
    
    10. Intellectual Property
    Report copyright concerns to support@squarecast.app. We‚Äôll address valid claims under applicable laws (e.g., EU Directive 2001/29/EC). Don‚Äôt misuse our trademarks (e.g., ‚ÄúSquareCast‚Äù) or content.
    
    11. Governing Law
    These Terms are governed by Hungarian law. Disputes will be resolved in Budapest courts, unless EU consumer laws grant you local jurisdiction.
    
    12. Changes
    We may modify these Terms. Significant changes will be notified via the app or email. Continued use after updates means you accept them.
